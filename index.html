    <p>This is a game about choices.<br>
      Life moves pretty fast, blink and you'll miss it. The game presents two characters meeting
      for the last time. You have to decide what to do before time runs out. A timer will be on
      the top left corner. So much of life is spent in indecision. Let this not be one. <be><br>
       Have the strength to choose life.</p>
